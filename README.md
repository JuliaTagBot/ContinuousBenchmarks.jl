# TuringBenchmarks 

This package has some benchmarking scripts for Turing. All models used here can be found in the `models` folder, all data can be found in the `data` folder, and all benchmarking scripts are in the `benchmarks` folder. 

Some data is generated via simulations found in the `simulations` folder. This data is generated when the package is built. When the package is built, `cmdstan` is also downloaded and setup where the URL can be accessed using `TuringBenchmarks.CMDSTAN_HOME`.

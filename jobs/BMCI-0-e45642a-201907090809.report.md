## Results Table:

Below is a table of this job's results, obtained by running the
benchmarks found in
[TuringLang/ContinuousBenchmarks](https://github.com/TuringLang/ContinuousBenchmarks). The
table shows the time ratio of the N (N >= 2) Turing commits
benchmarked. A ratio greater than `1.0` denotes a possible regression
(marked with :-1:), while a ratio less than `1.0` denotes a possible
improvement (marked with :+1:). Results are subject to
noise so small fluctuations around `1.0` may be ignored.
